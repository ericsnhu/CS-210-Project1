# project1
This project was a fun way to getting started with C++ and building confidence with code design. I think I did a good job at creating a user menu to create a more appealing user experience. I know believe that using a main and .h file could have made for a more immersive codebase, but I'm not sure if it would make the code run faster. I didn't find this to be too challenging, but I did run into issues with the the UTC time zone not wanting to compile my code. I used a online compiler called "onlinegdb" to run the code and ensure it ran correctly. I then found out through the professor that I could have used the "#pragma warning(disable : 4996)" to override the warning and compile the code. I believe the most useful skill which I will need in the future is how to effectively use two coding languages  in the same project. This is a challenging task in which I still require plenty of practice.
